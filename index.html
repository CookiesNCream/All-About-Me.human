    <p>Hi! I'm Linda, an IT Academic/Technical Consultant at Forte Consultancy Services. I'm motivated by my passion to creatively enhance the way users interact with computing devices because some form of user interface is utilized for such interactions. I wear many hats, from IT teaching, research, support, guiding, and inspiring, to user experience interviews, heuristic evaluation, scenario-based evaluation, usability testing, wireframing, prototyping, front-end and back-end development, server administration, project management, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and giving presentations. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading articles about technology and general knowledge.</p> 

    <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities in IT, Quality Assurance/Engineering, Web Design, User Experience, User Research, Human Factors, and User Interaction. I'm extremely passionate about innovation and invention across different disciplines, and enjoy collaborating with others in a variety of projects as much as receiving feedback and learning from others' viewpoints. I enjoy learning and applying new things, and am always dabbling with tools and breathing in new knowledge that are accessible to me. As such, I love solving problems, especially those without obvious answers, because when I do find answers, it is humbling, challenging, fulfilling, and exhilarating!</p>

    <p>I'm enthusiastic about learning new things and applying it to projects to provide the best user experience to end users and enhance my learning experience.</p> 

    <p>Please feel free to browse through <a title="Portfolio" href="portfolio url">some examples of my work</a>. Thanks for reading and don't hesitate to <a title="Connect" href="connect url">reach out to me</a> if you want to know more about my <a title="Resume" href="resume url">involvement and interests</a>.</p>
