<p>It is nice to be part of the GitHub community!
Here is how I would like to introduce myself. 
Hi! I'm Linda, a Technical Advisor / Consultant at InVINCIble Enterprises. I'm motivated by my passion to creatively enhance the way users interact with computing devices because some form of user interface is utilized for such interactions. 
I wear many hats, from IT training, research, support, guiding, and inspiring, to user experience interviews, heuristic evaluation, scenario-based evaluation, usability testing, wireframing, prototyping, front-end and back-end development, server administration, project management, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and technology evangelism. 
When I'm not working, I enjoy reading articles about technology and general knowledge over cups of coffee.</p>
<p>I'm extremely passionate about innovation and invention across different disciplines, and enjoy collaborating with others in a variety of projects as much as receiving feedback and learning from others' viewpoints. 
I enjoy learning and applying new things, and am always dabbling with tools and breathing in new knowledge that are accessible to me. 
As such, I love solving problems, especially those without obvious answers, because when I do find answers, it is humbling, challenging, fulfilling, and exhilarating!</p>
<p>I'm enthusiastic about learning new things and applying it to projects to provide the best user experience to end users and enhance my learning experience.</p>
